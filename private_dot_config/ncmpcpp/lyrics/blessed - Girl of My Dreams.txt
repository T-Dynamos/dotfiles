[Intro]
Ayah, Ayah Ayah Ayah
Ayah Ayah Ayah Ayah

[Verse 1]
In your walk, in your talk, in your work, I'm stirred up
In your smile, in your laughter, in your eyes, even anger
When you say yes, when you say no, oh
When you sit or when you stand

[Chorus]
I'm captivated, I'm elevated, sometimes sedated
And I know I've found the girl of my dreams
Girl of my dreams, Girl of my _
The girl of my dreams

[Verse 2]
She resides in my heart, she resided there
All the while, all I needed was just to spot the one
I had a perfеct picture of what she looked likе
Spiritual birth, the physical
Then I see you, I feel you
And I want to take your hand

[Chorus]
'Cause, I'm captivated, I'm elevated, sometimes sedated
And I know I've found, the girl of my dreams
Girl of my dreams, Girl of my _

[Bridge]
I'm bathing in the blue blessed in streams of spring
I'm excited and I feel like I can jump and touch the skies
I'm bathing in the blue blessed in streams of spring
So excited that I feel like I can jump and touch the skies

Baby, say yes, please don't say no, oh
In my world you are in hot demand
Baby, say yes, please don't say no, oh
When you shake and when you dance

[Chorus]
I'm captivated, I'm elevated, sometimes sedated
And I know I've found, I'm captivated, I'm elevated
Sometimes sedated, and I know i've found

[Post Chorus]
I know I've found
I know I've found
I know I've found
I know I've found

[Chorus]
I'm captivated, I'm elevated, sometimes sedated
And I know I've found
The girl of my _

[Outro]
Ayah, Ayah Ayah Ayah
Ayah Ayah Ayah Ayah
Ayah Ayah Ayah Ayah
Ayah, Ayah Ayah Ayah (dreams)
Ayah Ayah Ayah Ayah
Ayah Ayah Ayah Ayah
