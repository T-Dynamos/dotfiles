[Verse]
Past lives, Couldn't ever hold me down.
Lost love is sweeter when it's finally around
I've got the strangest feeling
this is not our first time around.
Past lives couldn't ever come between us
Sometimes the dreamers finally wake up
Don't wake me I'm not dreaming
Don't wake me I'm not dreaming
Past lives, Couldn't ever hold me down.
Lost love is sweeter when it's finally around
I've got the strangest feeling
This is not our first time around.
Past lives couldn't ever come between us
Sometimes the dreamers finally wake up
Don't wake me I'm not dreaming
Don't wake me I'm not dreaming
Past lives, Couldn't ever hold me down.
Lost love is sweeter when it's finally around
I've got the strangest feeling
This is not our first time around.
Past lives couldn't ever come between us
Sometimes the dreamers finally wake up
Don't wake me I'm not dreaming
Don't wake me I'm not dreaming
