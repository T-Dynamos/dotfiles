[Verse]
It doesn't matter anymore
It doesn't matter anymore
But I wish you and I talked a little bit longer
Before you put that crown on my head

[Hook]
Lord forgive me, yeah
I don't wanna go
I swear that I'm good where I'm at, yeah
The city trembles
They fear the worst
They need an angel
But I'm still a boy

[Verse 2]
Do you believe in me
What do you see in me?
Cause I'll be honest girl I don't feel a thing, hey
They see the best in me
But in my heart I feel like it's just a waste

[Chorus]
Break hearts, but you'll never break mine
Talk back, or stay girl I really don't care
The city trembles
They fear the worst
They need an angel
But I'm still a boy

[Solo]

[Bridge]
Break hearts, but you'll never break mine
Talk back, or stay girl I really don't care

[Chorus]
The city trembles
They fear the worst, yeah
They need an angel, oh no
So I'll take the sword, yeah
